HCI Sheridan SLATE app

This repository is for a Human Computer Interactions course assignment which involves using Figma. The main focus of this assignment is to practice prototyping using the best practices in order to incorporate better UI/UX design methodologies. This prototype is for a online eLearning platform i.e., SLATE which is used at Sheridan in order to access courses, assessments and everything related to a course.
With a focus on user experience and interactive applications development, this assignment aims at not only practicing prototyping but also ensures that research and readings into the basics of the topics are covered. The main end users of this app are students, instructors, administrators and parents/guardians. This assignment also heavily focuses on accessibility amongst other HCI guidelines.

5 new desired functionalities:

1. Integration of a site like Tutorocean inside Slate that allows the students to converse, meet and discuss topics asynchronously and synchronously with their course or program tutors.
2. Past notes/pointers from previous students - A tab for students to upload and share their personal notes, pointers, advice and help the future takers of the course.
3. Gamification - The platform could offer customization to students and change the aesthetic, or even gamify their learning. This can be done via interactive design and ui interface that allows students to look at their progress and set goals in a fun and effective manner.
4. Self-assessment - A tab for the end users of Slate, mainly the students and instructors that provides an easy to use interface like a survey or to do list that helps them understand their learning patterns, patterns of procrastination and time manangement say weekly/bi-weekly.
5. A way for inter-disciplinary communication i.e., students in other degrees/diplomas or courses can interact with each other. For example, a film and television student posting an announcement requesting the help of a student in a voice acting course to work on their project.
